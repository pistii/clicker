M2 fishbot

works perfectly with 1024x768 game resolution. (The inventory tab with fish openings doesn't exactly works as intended on bigger screens)
Here's how it works:
1. select the fishing area
2. set up buttons which need to be pressed F1-F4 and adjust the quantity
3. You can open fishes right after the bot fishes out. Most of the fishes supported.
4. Delay: (if needed) I use it with 30-50 ms delay and catches all the fish for me but it depends on your computer's speed.
5. Logout checkbox: Logs out the user after no more fish remained
6. PM checks if somebody wrote to you and sends a sound alert

   That's it! Enjoy
