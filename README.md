M2 fishbot

Here's how it works:
1. select the fishing area
2. set up buttons which need to be pressed F1-F4 and adjust the quantity
3. You can open fishes right after the bot fishes out. Most of the fishes supported, but all of them will be added later.
4. Delay: (if needed) I use it with 30-50 ms delay and catches most of the fish, but it depends on your computer's speed.
5. Logout checkbox: Logs out the user after no more fish remained
6. PM & trade are safety alerts checks if somebody wrote or trade and sends a sound alert

   That's it!
      Enjoy
